**Cavy** is a cross-platform integration test framework for React Native, by
[Pixie Labs](http://pixielabs.io).

This README covers installing and setting up Cavy, writing Cavy tests and FAQs.
For information on how to use Cavy's **command line interface**, check out
[cavy-cli][cli].

## How does it work?

Cavy (ab)uses React `ref` generating functions to give you the ability to refer
to, and simulate actions upon, deeply nested components within your
application. Unlike a tool like [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
which uses a simulated renderer, Cavy runs within your live application as it
is running on a host device (e.g. your Android or iOS simulator).

This allows you to do far more accurate integration testing than if you run
your React app within a simulated rendering environment.

### CLI and continuous integration

By default, Cavy outputs test results to the console when your app runs.
However, you can also run Cavy tests directly from the command line using
Cavy's own command line interface - [cavy-cli][cli]. Just set the `sendReport`
prop on your `<Tester>` component to `true` (see below).

Further details on how you can use cavy-cli to fully automate your tests with
continuous integration can be found [in the cavy-cli README][cli].

### Where does it fit in?

We built Cavy because, at the time of writing, React Native had only a handful
of testing approaches available:

1. Unit testing components ([Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)).
2. Shallow-render testing components ([enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)).
3. Testing within your native environment, using native JS hooks ([Appium](http://appium.io/)).
4. Testing completely within your native environment ([XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/reference/xctest)).

Cavy fits in between shallow-render testing and testing within your native
environment.

### Cavy's components

Cavy provides 3 tools to let you run integration tests:

1. A store of 'test hooks'; key-value pairs between a string identifier and a
   component somewhere in your app component tree.
2. A set of helper functions to write spec files.
3. A `<Tester>` component you wrap around your entire app to make the test hook
   store available, and autorun your test cases on boot.

## Installation

To get started using Cavy, install it using `yarn`:

    yarn add cavy --dev

or `npm`:

    npm i --save-dev cavy

## Basic usage

Check out [the sample app](https://github.com/pixielabs/cavy/tree/master/sample-app/EmployeeDirectory)
for example usage. Here it is running:

![Sample app running](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/126989/22829358/193b5c0a-ef9a-11e6-994e-d4df852a6181.gif)

### Hook up components for testing

Add 'hooks' to any components you want to test by adding a `ref` and using the
`generateTestHook` function.

`generateTestHook` takes a string as its first argument - this is the
identifier to be used in tests. It takes an optional second argument in case
you want to set your own `ref` generating function.

Stateless functional components cannot be assigned a `ref` since they don't
have instances. Use the `wrap` function to wrap them inside a non-stateless
component.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { TextInput } from 'react-native';
import { FuncComponent } from 'somewhere';

import { hook, wrap } from 'cavy';

class Scene extends Component {
  render() {
    const WrappedComponent = wrap(FuncComponent);
    return (
      <View>
        <TextInput
          ref={this.props.generateTestHook('Scene.TextInput')}
          onChangeText={...}
        />
        <WrappedComponent
          ref={this.props.generateTestHook('Scene.Component')}
          onPress={...}
        />
      </View>      
    );
  }
}

const TestableScene = hook(Scene);
export default TestableScene;
```

### Write your test cases

Using your component identifiers, write your spec functions. We suggest saving
these in a spec folder, naming them something like `./specs/AppSpec.js`.

```javascript
export default function(spec) {
  spec.describe('My feature', function() {
    spec.it('works', async function() {
      await spec.fillIn('Scene.TextInput', 'some string')
      await spec.press('Scene.button');
      await spec.exists('NextScene')
    });
  });
}
```

[See below](#available-spec-helpers) for a list of currently available spec
helper functions.

### Set up your test wrapper

Import `Tester`, `TestHookStore` and your specs in your top-level JS file
(typically this is your `index.{ios,android}.js` files), and instantiate a new
`TestHookStore`.

Wrap your app in a Tester component, passing in the `TestHookStore` and an
array containing your imported spec functions.

Optional props:

`waitTime`          - Integer, the time in milliseconds that your tests should
                      wait to find specified 'hooked' components.
                      Set to `2000` (2 seconds) by default.

`startDelay`        - Integer, the time in milliseconds before test execution
                      begins. Set to `0` by default.

`clearAsyncStorage` - Boolean, set this to `true` to clear AsyncStorage between
                      each test e.g. to remove a logged in user.
                      Set to `false` by default.

`sendReport`        - Boolean, set this to `true` to have Cavy send a report to
                      [cavy-cli][cli]. Set to `false` by default.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Tester, TestHookStore } from 'cavy';
import AppSpec from './specs/AppSpec';
import App from './app';

const testHookStore = new TestHookStore();

export default class AppWrapper extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Tester specs={[AppSpec]} store={testHookStore} waitTime={4000}>
        <App />
      </Tester>
    );
  }
}
```

**Congratulations! You are now all set up to start testing your app with Cavy.**

Your tests will run automatically when you run your app.

#### Apps that use native code

If you're not using [Create React Native App][crna], you'll need to register
your `AppWrapper` as the main entry point with `AppRegistry` instead of your
current `App` component:

```javascript
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AppWrapper', () => AppWrapper);
```

## Available spec helpers

`fillIn(identifier, str)` - fills in the identified 'TextInput'-compatible
component with the provided string (str). Your component must respond to the
property `onChangeText`.

`press(identifier)` - presses the identified component. Your component must
respond to the property `onPress`.

`pause(integer)` - pauses the running test for the length of time, specified in
milliseconds (integer). This is useful if you need to allow time for a response
to be received before progressing.

`exists(identifier)` - returns `true` if the component can be identified (i.e.
is currently on screen).

`notExists(identifier)` - as above, but checks for the absence of the
component.

`findComponent(identifier)` - returns the identified component. This function
should be used if your testable component does not respond to either
`onChangeText` or `onPress`, for example:

```javascript
picker = await spec.findComponent('Scene.modalPicker');
picker.open();
```

## FAQs

#### How does Cavy compare to Appium? What is the benefit?

Cavy is a comparable tool to Appium. The key difference is that Appium uses
native hooks to access components (accessibility IDs), wheras Cavy uses React
Native refs. This means that Cavy sits directly within your React Native
environment (working identically with both Android and iOS builds), making it
easy to integrate into your application very quickly, without much
overhead.

#### What does this allow me to do that Jest does not?

Jest is a useful tool for unit testing individual React Native components,
whereas Cavy is an integration testing tool allowing you to run end-to-end user
interface tests.

#### How about supporting stateless components?

We'd love for Cavy to be better compatible with stateless functional components
and would be more than happy to see its reliance on refs replaced with something
better suited to the task...
What that looks like specifically, we're not 100% sure yet. We're very happy to
discuss possible alternatives!
